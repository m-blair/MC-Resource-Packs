# MC-Resource-Packs

Preface:
===========================================
I do not recommend cloning this repository as it is meant to be a collection of different completed projects, rather than being used for monitoring projects in-progress.
In any case, just download the specific .zip file you want and follow the process below to get it running in your game!


How to Install MC Resource Packs:

1) Open Minecraft: Java Edition (Packs are compatible with versions 1.17+)
2) Select 'Options...'
3) Select 'Resource Packs...'
4) Select 'Open Pack Folder'
5) Drag desired .zip file into this folder
6) Return to 'Resource Packs...' screen in-game
7) Select desired resource pack under 'Available' column by clicking on the pack's thumbnail
8) If desired pack is under 'Selected' column, you're done!
